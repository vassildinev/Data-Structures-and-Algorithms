# Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity Homework #

1. **O(n^2)**
   
	For each element in the array, the while loop goes through each element as well

2. **Best case - O(n), Worst case - O(n\*m)**
   
	The complexity depends on the first `if` statement - if the statement is true, then the inner loop will be executed

3. **O(n\*m)**
   
	The algorithm uses recursion to calculate the sum of all elements in a matrix of integers
